# Bulldozer-Dataset-and-ML-Code
This repository has both the Dataset and the ML Code for Bulldozer problem. The code has been obtained as jupyter notebook from fast.ai and I have only added my understandings and small changes to the code so that it fits my notebook. This was one the first and the most amazing online courses that I attended and it was an influential point in helping me choose my career as a Data Scientist. It employs the Random Forest Regressor method with an intial EDA of the Data, followed by Building the first model, and then understanding the results, fine tuning the hyper parameters. It is a briliant course and I suggest all of you to take a look at it
