# Overview
This project is an outcome of the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) course that I had undergone. The course was spread over 9 lectures in which I was taught the logic behind the working of RandomForest Regressors and how it could be applied to a real world dataset(discussed below). 

It employs the Random Forest Regressor method with an intial EDA of the Data, followed by Building the first model, and then understanding the results, fine tuning the hyper parameters.The approaches taken, the insights obtained and the possible mistakes that could happen are discussed in detail and I have tried to include those in my notebook as well

# Dataset
The link for the data is given [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data). The data is sourced from Kaggle and it was part of a competition that was hosted by Kaggle.The dataset has 54 features of bulldozers including the sale price of bulldozers and the predictor variable. The goal behind the project is to build a model that would help predict the sales price of Bulldozers that range from the 1960's - 2011. The testing would be done on dataset from 2012.

There are 3 main datasets:
- **Train.csv** is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
- **Valid.csv** is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.
- **Test.csv** is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.




This repository has both the Dataset and the ML Code for the Bluebook for  Bulldozer problem. I have done this project as a part of Fast_ai coursework and I have only added my understandings and  changes to the code so that it fits the possibility of running in my limited GPU. This was one the first and the most amazing online courses that I attended and it was an influential point in helping me choose my career as a Data Scientist.
