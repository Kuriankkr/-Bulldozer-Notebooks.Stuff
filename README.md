# Bulldozer-Dataset-and-ML-Code
This repository has both the Dataset and the ML Code for the Bluebook for  Bulldozer problem. I have done this project as a part of Fast_ai coursework and I have only added my understandings and  changes to the code so that it fits the possibility of running in my limited GPU. This was one the first and the most amazing online courses that I attended and it was an influential point in helping me choose my career as a Data Scientist. It employs the Random Forest Regressor method with an intial EDA of the Data, followed by Building the first model, and then understanding the results, fine tuning the hyper parameters. It is a briliant course and I suggest all of you to take a look at it. The approaches taken, the insights obtained and the possible mistakes that could happen are discussed in detail and I have tried to include those in my notebook as well
